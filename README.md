About
-----

By default in Magento, for every category, you can chose on which product attribute the product collection should be sorted.
The problem is that you cannot choose the sorting direction.
This module adds a category attribute (check the "Display Settings" tab) and rewrites catalog/product_list block in order to manage the default sorting direction.

Backup!!!
---------
This module is provided "as is" and I'll not be responsible for any data damage.

Installation
------------

Simply download the whole repository and copy everything to your Magento document root.
Otherwise with modman:
```shell
modman clone https://github.com/fballiano/openmage-category-sort-direction
