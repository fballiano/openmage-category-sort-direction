Magento Category Sort Direction
===============================

Allows you to decide the product sorting direction on category pages

About
-----

By default in Magento, for every category, you can chose on which product attribute the product collection should be sorted.
The problem is that you cannot choose the sorting direction.
This module adds a category attribute (check the "Display Settings" tab) and rewrites catalog/product_list block in order to manage the default sorting direction.
